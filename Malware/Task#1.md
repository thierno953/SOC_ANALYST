# Identifying Known Malware Signatures

- This task demonstrates how to use YARA to detect known malware signatures within a suspicious file.

## Objectives

- Identify known malware patterns

- Understand how to write YARA rules

- Analyze a file for malicious indicators using YARA

#### Step 1: Create a YARA Rule

- Create a YARA rule file:

```sh
nano task1.yar
```

```sh
rule known_Malware_Signature {
    meta:
        description = "Detects known malware signatures"
        author = "Your Name"
        date = "2025-01-05"
        severity = "high"

    strings:
        $a = {6A 40 68 00 30 00 00 6A 14 8D 91}     // Hexadecimal sequence
        $b = "You are hacked"                      // Typical attack message

    condition:
        any of them
}
```

#### Step 2: Create a Suspicious File

- Create a file to scan:

```sh
nano file1.txt
```

> Contenu du fichier file1.txt :

```sh
--- BEGIN FILE HEADER ---
File ID: MAL-032021
Timestamp: 2025-01-12T08:24:10Z

```

#### Step 3: Scan the File with YARA

- Run YARA to scan the file for known malware signatures:

```sh
yara -s task1.yar file1.txt
```
