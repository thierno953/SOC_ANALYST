# Forensic Investigation

- It is a process of collecting, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence to identify, investigate, and resolve cybersecurity incidents.

#### Examples of phases in the process : `Preparation, Detection, Containment, Analysis, Recovery`

- It helps organizations respond to and recover from security breaches while building their defenses against future threats.

## Goal of Forensic Investigation

- Identify the root cause and scope of a cybersecurity incident (`malware`).

- Gather admissible evidence to support legal or disciplinary action.

- Determine how the attacker gained access and what data was compromised.

- Recommend actions to mitigate the current incident and prevent future attacks.

- Provide intelligence to improve an organization’s overall cybersecurity posture.
