**Objective**: Set up monitoring for unauthorized access attempts, trigger Fail2Ban to block malicious IPs, and analyze logs in Splunk.

- `Detailed level`: High
- `Difficulty level`: Medium

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Prerequisites**

1. Ensure you have an **Ubuntu Server** ready for this task.
2. Install the necessary tools:
   - Fail2Ban for SSH protection.
   - Splunk Universal Forwarder for log forwarding.

---

### **Step 2: Install and Configure Fail2Ban**

1. **Install Fail2Ban**:

   ```bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install fail2ban -y

   ```

2. **Configure Fail2Ban for SSH**:

   - Open the Fail2Ban configuration file:

     ```bash

     sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

     ```

   - Add the following lines to protect the SSH service:

     ```
     [sshd]
     enabled = true
     port = ssh
     logpath = /var/log/auth.log
     maxretry = 3
     bantime = 600
     findtime = 600

     ```

   - Save and close the file.

3. **Add Restart Fail2Ban** to apply changes:

   ```bash
   /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor /var/log/fail2ban.log
   sudo systemctl restart fail2ban

   ```

4. **Verify Fail2Ban Status**:

   ```bash

   sudo fail2ban-client status

   ```

   Look for the `sshd` jail in the output.

5. Create index and sourcetype in Splunk platform

   ```css
   Create index and sourcetype and name them as fail2ban_logs
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Configure Splunk for Log Monitoring**

1. Make sure your Universal forwarder is up and running on Ubuntu server.
2. **Set up log forwarding for Fail2Ban**:

   - Create an input configuration:

     ```bash

     sudo nano /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf

     ```

   - Add the following configuration to monitor Fail2Ban logs:

```
[monitor:///var/log/syslog]
disabled = false
index = linux_os_logs
sourcetype = syslog

[monitor:///var/log/auth.log]
disabled = false
index = security_incidents
sourcetype = linux_secure
whitelist = Failed|invalid|Denied

[monitor:///var/log/fail2ban.log]
disabled = false
sourcetype = fail2ban
index = fail2ban_logs

```

- Save and restart the Splunk Universal Forwarder:

  ```bash

  sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart

  ```

### **Step 4: Simulate Unauthorized SSH Access**

1.  ```bash
    ssh user@<target-ip>

    ```

### **Step 3: Simulate a Brute-Force Attack with Hydra**

1. **Prepare a wordlist** with common passwords:

   - Use a pre-existing wordlist (e.g., `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`) or create a custom one:

     ```bash

     echo -e "password123\nadmin123\n12345678\ntestpass" > passwords.txt

     ```

2. **Run Hydra** to perform the brute-force attack:

   ```bash

   hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt <target-ip> ssh

   ```

   - Replace `<target-ip>` with the IP address of the Ubuntu server.

3. **Observe Fail2Ban Action**:

   - As the attack progresses, Fail2Ban will detect multiple failed login attempts and block the attacking IP.
   - Check Fail2Ban logs on the server:

     ```bash

     tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log

     ```

4. **Monitor Fail2Ban Logs**:

   ```bash

   tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log

   ```

   - Check for entries indicating that Fail2Ban has banned the attacking IP.

### **Step 5: Analyze Logs in Splunk**

1. **Log in to Splunk** and navigate to the Search and Reporting App.
2. Use the following SPL query to identify blocked IPs:

   ```

   index=linux_logs sourcetype=fail2ban action="ban"

   ```

3. **Visualize Results**:
   - Create a dashboard to monitor trends of failed login attempts and banned IPs.

---

### **Step 6: Validate Incident Response**

1. **Validate Banned IPs**:

   ```bash

   sudo fail2ban-client status sshd

   ```

   Verify the attacking IP is listed as banned.

2. **Unban IPs (if needed)**:

   ```bash

   sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <banned-ip>

   ```
