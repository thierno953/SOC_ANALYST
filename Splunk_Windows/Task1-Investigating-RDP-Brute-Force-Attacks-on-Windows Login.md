## Objective

The objective of this task is to detect, investigate, and respond to brute-force attacks targeting the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on a Windows machine. This task uses Sysmon and Splunk to monitor failed and successful login attempts and identify suspicious patterns indicative of an attack.  
`Detail-Level` - Medium

## Steps

1. Setting up Windows Machine
2. Setting up Splunk
3. Simulate the attack and Visualize the alert
4. Incident Response

### 1. Setting up Windows Machine

- Edit the inputs.conf file

```
[WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
disabled = 0
index = sysmon_logs
sourcetype = XmlWinEventLog:Sysmon
renderXml = false

```

### 2. Setting up Splunk

- Create a Sourcetype(if required)
- Install Sysmon App from Splunkbase

### 3. Simulate the attack and Visualize the alert

- Use manual login attempts or tools liek Hydra

```
hydra -l administrator -P /path/to/passwords.txt rdp://<windows-machine-ip>
```

- Visualize the event on Splunk Dashboard

```
index="sysmon_logs"  sourcetype = XmlWinEventLog:Sysmon
```

### 4. Incident Response

### **Incident Response**

1. **Block Malicious IPs**:

- Use the Windows Firewall to block suspicious IP addresses:

```
        powershell
        Copy code
        New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block RDP Brute Force" -Direction Inbound -Action Block -RemoteAddress 139.84.176.244

```

2. **Reset Compromised Accounts**:
   - Reset passwords for compromised accounts:

```
       net user <username> <new_password>

```

3. **Enable Account Lockout Policy**:
   - Set a lockout policy to prevent repeated brute-force attempts:

```
        secpol.msc
```

        - Navigate to `Account Lockout Policy` and configure:
            - Lockout Threshold: 5 failed attempts.
            - Lockout Duration: 15 minutes.
