### **Objective**

The objective of this task is to detect, investigate, and respond to malicious or unauthorized PowerShell activity on a Windows machine using Sysmon and Splunk. The focus is on identifying suspicious PowerShell commands, encoded scripts, and activities such as file downloads or executions from non-standard paths.

### **Steps**

1. Setting up Windows Machine
2. Setting up Splunk
3. Simulating the attack and Visualizing the alert
4. Incident Response

---

### **1. Setting up Windows Machine**

- Install and configure Sysmon:

  - Install Sysmon with a predefined configuration:
    ```powershell
    sysmon.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml
    ```
  - Verify Sysmon installation:
    ```cmd
    sc query sysmon64
    ```

- Edit the `inputs.conf` file for Sysmon logs:

  ```plaintext
  [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
  disabled = 0
  index = sysmon_logs
  sourcetype = XmlWinEventLog:Sysmon
  renderXml = false

  ```

---

### **2. Setting up Splunk**

- Configure the Splunk Universal Forwarder:

  - Edit `inputs.conf` for PowerShell and Security logs:
    ```plaintext
    [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational]
    disabled = 0
    index = powershell_logs
    sourcetype = WinEventLog:PowerShell
    ```

- Configure outputs to send logs to the Splunk Indexer:

  - Verify the connection:
    ```cmd
    splunk list forward-server
    ```

- Install Sysmon App for Splunk from Splunkbase.

---

### **3. Simulating the Attack and Visualizing the Alert**

- Simulate a suspicious file download:
  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\eicar.com.txt"
  ```
- Visualize the events on the Splunk dashboard:

```
index="sysmon_logs" sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Sysmon" "*eicar*"
```

![Splunk](/Splunk_Windows/assets/08.png)

- Example of detected events:

  - Event 1: Process creation with Invoke-WebRequest.
  - Event 2: File creation for eicar.com.txt.

### 4. Incident Response

1. Terminate Malicious Processes:

- Identify and kill malicious PowerShell processes:

```
Stop-Process -Name powershell -Force
```

2. Block Malicious IPs:

- Block suspicious outbound connections:

```
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Malicious IP" -Direction Outbound -Action Block -RemoteAddress <malicious-ip>
```

3. Set Up Alerts for Future Incidents:

- Create a Splunk alert for suspicious PowerShell commands:

```
index=sysmon_logs EventCode=1 CommandLine="*Invoke-WebRequest*" OR CommandLine="*EncodedC
```
